// Questions:
// 1. Load data from local file (path: “https://ac.aws.citizennet.com/assets/qspreviews/qs_interview_data.json”)
// 2. Use the screenshot as an example, implement a generic function for reading any JSON file in that format, then display the top 12 brands based on audience_size. We always want to have 4 items in one row.
// 3. Add a hover state with a dark, semi-transparent overlay and display the ID of the hovered brand.
